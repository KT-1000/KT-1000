### Hello 👋

I'm KT, my pronouns are they/them/she/her, and I lead the [Boundary](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/boundary) engineering team at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/about). To see the rest of my work in tech, check [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kt-simmons/) - it's all leadership, infrastructure and reliability!

Outside of work, I love:

📚 [Reading books](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/annihilatrix), especially horror!

📼 [Watching scary movies](https://letterboxd.com/annihilatrix)

💀 Walking around cemeteries

🚲 Riding my bike, preferably next to a lake

♐ Getting way too into astrology and tarot

🍜 Figuring out which restaurant to try this weekend
