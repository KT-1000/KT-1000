### Hello 👋

I'm KT, my pronouns are they/them, and I lead the [Boundary](https://www.boundaryproject.io/) Cloud engineering team at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/about). To see the rest of my work in tech, check [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/katie-simmons/) - it's all infrastructure and reliability!

Outside of work, I love:

📚 [Reading books](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/annihilatrix), especially horror!

📼 [Watching scary movies](https://letterboxd.com/annihilatrix)

🎙️ Talking about weird genre films with my brother Joe on [our podcast](https://genre-fans.simplecast.com/) or [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-w2WHonq9Xn_yarLGOgDrg)

💀 Walking around cemeteries

🚲 Riding my bike, preferably next to a lake

♐ Getting way too into astrology and tarot

🍜 Figuring out which restaurant to try this weekend
